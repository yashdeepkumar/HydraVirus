# HydraVirus
A fun yet annoying virus aptly named Hydra for if a head is lost two more will take its spot.

This is a visual basic script(.vbs) file. To change the number of appearances of message boxes you can alter the for loop. By default it is kept to 5 msg boxes.

To terminate the virus shutdown the computer and give it some time(the task manager will be of no use).

You can also alter the msg in the alert msg box by changing the string from "virus is detected" to any string you want.

Do not try it on yourself as it will probabaly lead to stack overflow. CAUTION!!!!!!!
